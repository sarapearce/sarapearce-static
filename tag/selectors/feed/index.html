				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got to spend more time coding today than I normally get, so I&#8217;m happy to say I fell like some progress was made. Normally, I only get in 30-45 min a day so it gets hard to have any sense of accomplishment. But not today, my friend, today I finished. . . ok, nothing is complete yet.</p>
<p>I got my d3 datadashboard sample up on github and worked on it for a while. Currently nothing shows on the page, but I am sure I&#8217;ll figure out why soon. I&#8217;m also trying to do version control through github on it now because. . Â . the structural damage I&#8217;ve done to this site cannot be fixed in any reasonable time frame because I can&#8217;t find the cause. SO, I&#8217;ll be deleting and rebuilding because I have messed up this theme. If you have tried to click on any of the historical links and found they don&#8217;t work, that&#8217;s the error I&#8217;m trying to fix. I&#8217;m pretty sure if anyone has come here they&#8217;ve tried to click the historical links and said. . . nope, her links don&#8217;t work. sigh. Can&#8217;t leave that kinda bug sitting for long. Time has run out. I nuke the theme tonight and rebuild fresh. Next time: version control. I guess they&#8217;re called best practices for a reason. . .and now, back to Indeed.com.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a desktop selfie from earlier. </p>
