				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got to spend more time coding today than I normally get, so I&#8217;m happy to say I fell like some progress was made. Normally, I only get in 30-45 min a day so it gets hard to have any sense of accomplishment. But not today, my friend, today I finished. . . ok, nothing is complete yet.</p>
<p>I got my d3 datadashboard sample up on github and worked on it for a while. Currently nothing shows on the page, but I am sure I&#8217;ll figure out why soon. I&#8217;m also trying to do version control through github on it now because. . Â . the structural damage I&#8217;ve done to this site cannot be fixed in any reasonable time frame because I can&#8217;t find the cause. SO, I&#8217;ll be deleting and rebuilding because I have messed up this theme. If you have tried to click on any of the historical links and found they don&#8217;t work, that&#8217;s the error I&#8217;m trying to fix. I&#8217;m pretty sure if anyone has come here they&#8217;ve tried to click the historical links and said. . . nope, her links don&#8217;t work. sigh. Can&#8217;t leave that kinda bug sitting for long. Time has run out. I nuke the theme tonight and rebuild fresh. Next time: version control. I guess they&#8217;re called best practices for a reason. . .and now, back to Indeed.com.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a desktop selfie from earlier. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here&#8217;s the progress for today. I drew some svg rectangles inside an HTML table just as placeholders for where the data output is supposed to go. Then I started diving into d3 more. I tried to get an example to output for me so I can see how to connect json data into the graph structure for display. The example I have has two large json files that then populate the data for the map. I&#8217;m now working on getting the json to be read from a file (like it was in the sample code) but somehow I&#8217;m not getting the path correct locally or on the ftp. Guess there&#8217;s a problem to solve.  I&#8217;m trying to recreate this: </p>
<p><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/4657115/">My Map Example</a></p>
<p>Here are some desktop selfies and a snapshot of the html file with the css/js. I might have to put it up on github soon since now I&#8217;m up to 146 lines and a couple of files, so screen shots don&#8217;t quite work so well anymore. . . </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it looks today: (no map yet. . . )</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a snip of one of the json files</p>
