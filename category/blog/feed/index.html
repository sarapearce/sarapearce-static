				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got to spend more time coding today than I normally get, so I&#8217;m happy to say I fell like some progress was made. Normally, I only get in 30-45 min a day so it gets hard to have any sense of accomplishment. But not today, my friend, today I finished. . . ok, nothing is complete yet.</p>
<p>I got my d3 datadashboard sample up on github and worked on it for a while. Currently nothing shows on the page, but I am sure I&#8217;ll figure out why soon. I&#8217;m also trying to do version control through github on it now because. . Â . the structural damage I&#8217;ve done to this site cannot be fixed in any reasonable time frame because I can&#8217;t find the cause. SO, I&#8217;ll be deleting and rebuilding because I have messed up this theme. If you have tried to click on any of the historical links and found they don&#8217;t work, that&#8217;s the error I&#8217;m trying to fix. I&#8217;m pretty sure if anyone has come here they&#8217;ve tried to click the historical links and said. . . nope, her links don&#8217;t work. sigh. Can&#8217;t leave that kinda bug sitting for long. Time has run out. I nuke the theme tonight and rebuild fresh. Next time: version control. I guess they&#8217;re called best practices for a reason. . .and now, back to Indeed.com.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a desktop selfie from earlier. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For my coding time today I did some boring stuff that doesn&#8217;t really justify pictures. I had to clean up some directories on my ftp, got a circle to change colors in d3 and hopefully can find time tonight to write something from scratch using the circle example and d3. I also spent a good amount of time reading basic d3 documentation. Again, not very photo worthy. BUT research is always important. Good thing I love to read. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here&#8217;s the progress for today. I drew some svg rectangles inside an HTML table just as placeholders for where the data output is supposed to go. Then I started diving into d3 more. I tried to get an example to output for me so I can see how to connect json data into the graph structure for display. The example I have has two large json files that then populate the data for the map. I&#8217;m now working on getting the json to be read from a file (like it was in the sample code) but somehow I&#8217;m not getting the path correct locally or on the ftp. Guess there&#8217;s a problem to solve.  I&#8217;m trying to recreate this: </p>
<p><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/4657115/">My Map Example</a></p>
<p>Here are some desktop selfies and a snapshot of the html file with the css/js. I might have to put it up on github soon since now I&#8217;m up to 146 lines and a couple of files, so screen shots don&#8217;t quite work so well anymore. . . </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it looks today: (no map yet. . . )</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a snip of one of the json files</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You probably are not thinking of the title for today&#8217;s post in the same way that I am. That phrase can mean at least 3 different things (by my current count). I&#8217;m using it today because I am taking a lot of interview exams today. So far, the count is at 3. Unfortunately, that means I can&#8217;t write for data dashboard much today since these take priority. Oh well, I&#8217;ll just be a test generating machine. </p>

I&#8217;m not especially familiar with this theme, I&#8217;m using it for the first time for this run at job hunting. So I&#8217;m just reading a lot for now and pondering. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: 'HelveticaNeue-Light'">Welcome visitor! You&#8217;ve stumbled upon my blog related to my construction of a data dashboard. I&#8217;m doing this because I need an outlet for my coding. I was working at a software company as a web applications developer and was let go in a downsizing right before Christmas (boo!) Since I had become accustomed to programming for hours on end every day, I soon found that the absence of that has been really profound. So as any good developer would do, if there&#8217;s nothing to code, create something to code. And so the data dashboard was born.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m choosing to create a data dashboard because it&#8217;s a perfect marriage of all of my current interests: data representation, UI/UX and interface design, prototyping, d3, and trying to be lazy with WordPress but ultimately making more work for myself (all you WordPress folks know what I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout!)</p>
<p>Without further ado. . . I present to you today&#8217;s work. I did a mockup in Balsamiq for what I want the prototype of the dashboard to look like. My plan is to code out this design first and get the d3 to present a placeholder svg file, then once that is stable, I can start generating representations using R and then make this a more feature rich UI.</p>
<p>Below you&#8217;ll see my png export from Balsamiq of the prototype.</p>
